      <p>"I study German and French. I think languages are quite interesting because you get little nuances in words that reveal something about the culture of that language. My sweatshirt says, 'Crap, I left my unicorn in the spaceship!', in case you were wondering..."</p>

     <p>"Hi, I’m Giles, third year studying Film and Literature.  When I came to Warwick I didn’t intend to get anything resembling a campus reputation. I knew I had one however when I was asked if I was the guy who brought in a wooden katana and had security called on him. I was running for a Society President role and, for some reason, really thought it would be a good idea to bring one in. Whether this is a good thing or something to clarify in job interviews as “it’s worse than it sounds” has yet to be revealed."</p>

      <p>"University is hard, I can from a small village went to a small school where you were valued for your ideas and appreciated. At uni half the people on my own course don't know who I am, my whole school knew I was before, now no one does."</p></div>

        <h2>Tom, 23</h2>
        <p>"They say university is meant to be the best part of your life, everyone says they enjoy it and they join all these societies. I've tried but I don't drink and they always seem too cliquey and I end up standing in the corner by myself while people enjoy hanging out with their friends. I'm better off staying at home alone, at least I have TV."</p>

        <p>"First year has been fun. I've made new friends, joined new clubs, started new sports and found my house for next year. However I haven't put much effort in and they say you have to in second year, does that mean next year won't be as good. Everyone moans about the buses, I think I'm not going to be able to attend uni events as a result or not be able to balance my work load even if I try to..."</p>

        <h2>Tabitha, 20</h2>
        <p>"This is my final year. I can't wait to go. The university is so unsupportive, my friends have dropped out because of it, other friends go home as much as possible, I live to get away from home to do that. I don't know if it's just my course but I'm really worried about the future and I know no one will care."</p></div>
