      <p>"I study German and French. I think languages are quite interesting because you get little nuances in words that reveal something about the culture of that language. My sweatshirt says, 'Crap, I left my unicorn in the spaceship!', in case you were wondering..."</p>

     <p>"Hi, I’m Giles, third year studying Film and Literature.  When I came to Warwick I didn’t intend to get anything resembling a campus reputation. I knew I had one however when I was asked if I was the guy who brought in a wooden katana and had security called on him. I was running for a Society President role and, for some reason, really thought it would be a good idea to bring one in. Whether this is a good thing or something to clarify in job interviews as “it’s worse than it sounds” has yet to be revealed. " Hi,I’m Giles, third year studying Film and Literature.
